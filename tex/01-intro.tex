\section{Notation}

Whenever is something vector or matrix, we will use brackets "[,]" to select
items from it. We will try to always enumerate and index from zero 0, for
example sequence $X$ of length $n$ is $X_0X_1\dots X_{n-1}$. Usually sets and
other collection of objects will be denoted by uppercase letter and their
members will be denoted by lowercase equivalent  with index starting at 0.
Sequences and strings will by denoted either by uppercase or lowercase letters
and symbols will be denoted by same letter with index starting at 0.

Substrings: if $X=X_0X_1\dots X_n$ is sequence, then
$X\left[a:b\right]=X_aX_{a+1}\dots X_{b-1}$. Therefore $X[0:|X|]=X$. Prefix of
sequence $X$ of length $k$ is $X[:k]$. Suffix of $X$ starting at position $k$ is
$X[k:]$.
